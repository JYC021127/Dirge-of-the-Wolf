GameTitle: Dirge of the Wolf
GameBlurb: “Dirge of the Wolf” is a real-time strategy and survival game that incorporates time and resource management and the control of unique combat mechanics within a tainted world. By playing as the wolf king, the player needs to defeat scattered soul-eating enemies and gather the souls of the fallen wolf spirits. With strategic skills and utilization of resources from the surroundings, the king will ultimately boost their strength, defeat the boss of the land, and seize their territory. The primary objective of the player is to gather as many fallen souls as possible and maximise resources within a short period of time, and finally, capture the land by defeating specific bosses within 5 minutes in different regions.
